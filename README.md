### Purpose
This is a .NET application, that controls a motorized x-y translational stage ([Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=BBD203)), and a time-to-digital converter ([Swabian Instruments](https://www.swabianinstruments.com/time-tagger/)). 
The application can acquire data for two-dimensional heatmaps of photon countrates vs position. Some of the resulting images are shown further below.
